# playchess
An experiment in training a neural network to play chess. This project contains two types of chess engines:  
A standard search and evaluate algorithm can be found in 'lookahead'  
A neural network which suggests moves can be found in 'intuition'  
The learn folder contains scripts which allow a user to build, train and inspect a chess playing neural model.
